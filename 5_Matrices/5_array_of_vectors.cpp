/*
Advantages:

* This matrix will have dynamic rows which are different from dynamic rows in double pointer matrix since and in the latter we will have to first allocate a size to the rows. An array of vector can have rows will any number of columns.
* It is easy to pass to an function since we don't need to pass it as pointer/array of pointers.

Disadvantages:

* Not as cache friendly.
