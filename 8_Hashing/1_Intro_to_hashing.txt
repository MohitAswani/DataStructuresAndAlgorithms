Introduction of Hashing:

1)It is used to implement dictionaries/maps and sets.

2)It does search, insert and delete operation in O(1) time which is much better than any other data structure.

3)But for some operations it is very costly .Like for sorting or for finding keys just smaller than 
or just bigger takes a high cost.

4)Not useful for:
    * Finding closest keys.
    * Sorted order .
    (For the above two operations we use AVL tree or red black tree)
    * Prefix searching 
    (For this we use trie data structure)


Application of Hashing:

Second most used data structures after arrays.

1)Implementing dictionaries/maps.

2)Database indexing. (or we use B or B+ indexing)

3)Cryptography

4)Caches (in websites)

5)Symbol tables in compilers/instructors : used to detect keywords

6)Routers

7)Getting data from databases : used in associative arrays for storing data.

8)Many more.
