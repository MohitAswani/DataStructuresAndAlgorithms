/*
Unordered map used to store key,value pair but difference from map being its implementation using hashing.
(Simple is implemented using red-black tree)

Another difference being map stores key in order but unordered doesnot.

So it is basically a map only with faster insert,delete and search(with O(1)).

TIME COMPLEXITIES:

O(1):
begin()
end()
size()
empty()

O(1) on average:
Searching:
count()
find()
[]
at

Deletion:
erase(key)

Insertion:
insert

insert()
