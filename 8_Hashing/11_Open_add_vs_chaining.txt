************Chaining**********

1)Hash table never fills.
2)Less sensitive to hash function.
3)Poor cache performance.
4)Extra space for links.

PERFROMANCE: (1+alpha)
Eg : alpha=0.9 ,perf=1.9

************Open addressing**********

1)Table may become full and resizing becomes mandatory.
2)Extra cases requirred for clustering.
3)Cache friendly.
4)Extra space might be needed to achieve same performance as chaining.

PERFROMANCE: 1/(1-alpha)
Eg : alpha=0.9 ,perf=10
So we need to reduce the aplha -> increase the size of the hash table.


*************FINAL CONCLUSION*************

If we know the size of the chain in advance and can avoid table resizing (hence have extra space) , we can use open addressing.

But if we want to use dynamic structure and have better performance we use chaining.
