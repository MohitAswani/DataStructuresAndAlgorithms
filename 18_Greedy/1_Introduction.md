# Greedy algorithms :

* Mainly useful for optimization problems ( problems in which we need to maximize or minimize something).

* General structure of greedy algorithms : ![](2022-07-31-10-20-19.png)

* So the idea of greedy algorithms where we pick the best looking solution at every step may not work always. ![](2022-07-31-10-22-33.png)

* For NP hard problems ( problem which cannot be solved in polynomial time) greedy provides close to optimal solution. Eg : travelling salesman problem.
