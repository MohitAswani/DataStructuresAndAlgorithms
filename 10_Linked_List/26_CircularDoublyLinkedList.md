# Circular doubly linked list :

* A circular doubly linked list is a data structure that consists of a collection of nodes, where each node contains a reference to its next and previous nodes.

* Previous of head is the last node and next of last node is the head.

* Empty circular doubly linked list is represented by null.

* A single node circular doubly linked list is represented by a node with next and prev both pointing to itself.

## Advantages :

* We get all the advantages of a doubly linked list and circular linked list.

* We can access the last node in constant time without maintaining extra tail pointer/reference.
