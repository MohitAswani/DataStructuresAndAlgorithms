 * @brief Since the divisors exist in pairs, if there is any prime divisor (other than 1 and n itself) it will exist from 2 to n^(Â½). 
 * Since we are dividing it completely by the prime numbers, till the time it reaches the composite number it will not remain divisible by the composite number.
 * But when our last prime factor , the largest prime factor, has only a power 1 then we fall into a case such that the number is not printed.
 * 
 * Time complexity : O(n^1/2).
 * Auxillary space : O(1).
