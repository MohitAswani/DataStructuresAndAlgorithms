/**
 * @brief In the following problem we are given some ranges and we need to find the frequency of maximum occuring element in those ranges.
 *
 * To solve the problem we make the array where we store the frequencies of all the element.
 * First of all for all the starting pts we mark one in that array.
 * And for all the end pts we mark -1 at the pt next to them.
 * Then we find the prefix sum of the array.
 *
 * This array gives us the frequency of all the occuring elements.
 * Only constraint that we need to follow is that ranges in which the element occur must be less than a particular value.
 *
 * Time complexity : O(max(R))
 * Auxillary space : O(max(R))
 *
 * @param L
 * @param R
