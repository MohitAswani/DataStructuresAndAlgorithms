There are two types of ways to use string in cpp:

1) C-style strings
    int main(){
        char str[]="gfg";  when we add "" the compiler auto-matically add '\0' to the end of the string
        cout<<str;
        return 0;
    }

    char str[6]="gfg" will have the following array g f g \0 \0 \0

    char str[]="gfg" and sizeof(str) will give 4 due to '\0'

    char str[]={'g','f','g'} and if we print this string the output is not defined and its length is only 3.

    char str[]={'g','f','g','\0'} we must add '\0' if we use it as a string.

    Functions:
    1)strlen(str)
    2)strcmp(s1,s2) compares them lexicographically
    (We cannot use assignment operator with array of char / C style strings hence we use strcpy for assignment)
    3)strcpy(s1,s2) copies s2 to s1.

2) Cpp strings:

    Richer library

    Supports operators like +,<,>,==,>=,<=

    Can assign a string later

    Do not have to worry about its size because it is dynamically allocated

    Can be converted to C style if needed

    Functions:

    int main()
    {
        string str = "geeksforgeeks";
        cout << str.length() << " "; length of the string
        str = str + "xyz"; concatenation
        cout << str << " "; 
        cout << str.substr(1, 3) << " "; gives the substring , parameters : beginning index, length of the substring
        cout << str.find("eek") << " "; finds a string in a given string
        return 0;
    }

    cin takes the string upto a space

    To input a whole line we use getline(str) which takes the string till the user enters 'Enter'

    Also in getline(cin,str,char) we can enter a character where it stops by default it stops at \n

    To iterate through the string we can use range based loop
