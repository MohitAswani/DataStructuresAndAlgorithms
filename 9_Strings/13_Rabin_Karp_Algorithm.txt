In rabin-karp algorithmn instead of comparing the characters directly we calculate the hash value of every window of the text and if it matches the hash 
value of pattern we compare the pattern with that window.

ROLLING HASH:

And instead of manually calculating the hash value for each window we use window sliding technique for calculating hash and this is know as rolling hash.

t(i+1)=t(i)+txt[i+m]-txt[i]

Spurious hit : when the window has the same characters as the pattern but not in the same order

We encouter Spurious hit when we use basic hash function.

So to avoid such issues we use a better hash function.

So instead of just adding the ASCII values we find the weighted sum of the characters and hence the formula for rolling hash becomes:

t(i+1)=d(t(i)-txt[i]*(d^(m-1)))+txt[i+m]
m->length of pattern
