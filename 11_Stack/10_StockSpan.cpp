 * @brief In this problem we need to find the span of stocks.

 *
 * In the naive approach we use two loops to find the solution.
 * 
 * Time complexity : O(n^2)
 * Auxillary space : O(1)

 * @brief To solve this problem efficient we make the following observations :
 * 
 * 1) If there is greater element on the left side of the current element then the span is (Index of current element-Index of closest greater element on left side).
 * 
 * 2) Other the span is index of current element + 1.
 * 
 * 3) To find the element greater than the current element we need all the elements which were greater than the previous element and we need them in LIFO order.
 * 
 * To better understand the solution watch the video : 'Stock span problem'
 * 
 * Time complexity : O(n)       // Since every element is push and pop only once hence at max the only 2n stack operations are performed hence the time complexity is O(n)
 * Auxillary space : O(n)      // Since at max only n elements can be present in the stack and that is when the elements are in decreasing order.
 * @param stock
