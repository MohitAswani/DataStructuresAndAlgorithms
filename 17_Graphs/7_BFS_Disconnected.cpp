 * This code is similiar to the previous one the only difference being that this is also valid for disconnected graph.
 *
 * For eg :
                  1                       4
                /   \                    / \
               0     3                  5---6
                \   /
                  2
            BFS with source = 0 : 0 1 2 3
            BFS with source = 4 : 4 5 6
            Combinned : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
 *
 * The basics of traversal of the graph remain same, the main difference is that we traverse the adj list in a seperate function and mentain a visited array in that. If a vertex is not visited we call the BFS for it and pass the visited array to the BFS.
 *
 * And BFS prints all the nodes connected to the source we passed.
 *
 * After that we traverse the list and again and repeat the above process.
 *
 * This prints all the vertices of a graph connected or not.
