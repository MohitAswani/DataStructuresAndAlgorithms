# Graph representation

* We can represent graphs in the following ways: 
    1) Adjacency matrix

    2) Adjacency list

## Adjacency matrix

* We represent the graph as a matrix of V*V.

* The value at mat[i][j]=1 if there is an edge from i to j.

* For undirected graph this matrix is always symmetrix because for (i,j) (j,i) also exists.

* For directed graph this matrix may or may not be symmetric.
