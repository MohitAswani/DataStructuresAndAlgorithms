 * @brief
 *
 * SPANNING TREE : these are trees (so no cycles) which connect all the vertices directly or indirectly without cycles.
 *
 * MINIMUM SPANNING TREE : the spanning tree with minimum sum of weights of all the edges.
 *
 * MINIMUM SPANNING TREE PROBLEM : in this problem we will be given a weighted,undirected and connected graph and we need to find the minimum spanning tree of the graph. (every MST has V-1 edges)
 *
 * PRIM'S ALGORITHM : * In this algorithm we divide the vertices in two sets.
                      * One set containing the vertices which are in MST and other set having the ones which are not.
                      * So first we select any vertex and find the edge with minimum weight connecting the vertices in MST to ones not in MST.
                      * And we keep doing till all the vertices are in MST.
                      * For better understanding watch the video : "Prim's Algorithm/Minimum Spanning Tree"
 * PRIM'S ALGORITHM moves step by step and makes greedy choice at each point.
 *
 * IMPLEMENTAION EXPLANATION : 
                               * First we take a boolean array which tells where the element at index i is included in the MST or not.
                               * We take a key array and store the edges of min length connecting mst to non-mst in this array.
                               * To implement the key part we first initialize the key as infinite. Then we initialize the key at 0 as 0.
                               * Then we find the minimum edge (which connect mst to non mst's) which is not included in the MST.
                               * Then we included the vertice connected to minimum edge to the mst.
                               * Then we update the key array with the weight of the edges connecting the min edge vertice with vertices which are not in mst .
                               * For better understanding of this concept watch the lecture : "Implementation of Prim's Algorithm C++".
 *
 * Time complexity : theta(V^2) (We can make the time complexity of this algorithm = O((V+E)logV) by using a adjacency list and a priority_queue for key.)
 *
 * Auxillary space : O(V)
 * 
 * @param graph
 * @return int
