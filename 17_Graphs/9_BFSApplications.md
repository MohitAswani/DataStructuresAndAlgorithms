# Applications of BFS:

**Shortest path in a unweighted graph**: since BFS finds all the edges connected a vertex hence it also finds the shortest path. Also the shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra's also use the BFS to find the shortest path and instead of using normal queue they use priority queue (for weighted graphs).

**Crawlers in search engine**: go to pages and then their neighbours and their neighbours.

**Peer to peer networks**

**Social Network Search**: shows us our friends, then their friends and so on.

**In garbage collection**: searches the memory which is reachable by the system a memory is not its deleted

**Cycle detection**: both DFS & BFS are used in cycle detection.

**Ford fulkerson algorithm**: a maximum flow algorithm and BFS provides better time complexity in comparision to DFS.

**Broadcasting**: systems broadcast to their neighbours which in turn broadcast to their neighbours.

(There are many more applications of BPS and many algorithms based on BFS).
