/**
 * @brief In this problem we need to find the amount of time it will require to burn the binary tree if we start burning from a given leaf.
 *
 * Basically this question can be seen as find the farthest from the given leaf.
 *
 * We assume that we are always given a leaf node.
 * 
 * In this function we do the following two things :
 * 
 * 1) We find the height of the tree and return the height.
 * 2) We find if the child subtrees of the node contain the requirred leaf node. If it is in the left-subtree we  take the dist from that node and increment it by one and find the maximum value of dist from that node + height of right subtree. And we do the same if its in the right subtree.
 * 
 * This will give us the required answer.
 * 
 * Time complexity : O(n)
 * Auxillary space : O(h)
 *  
 * @param root
 * @param leaf
 * @param dist
 * @return ll
