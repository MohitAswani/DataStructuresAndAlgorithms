 * @brief To print a new line after every level we make the use of NULL pointer. After we traverse every level we push NULL into the queue.
 *
 * So for root we push NULL after pushing root.
 *
 * When we encounter a NULL in the queue it means that we have completely travesed the current level and hence we print a new line and push another NULL into the queue.
 *
 * So we use NULL as a next level marker.
 *
 * Time complexity : Theta(n+h) (becuase every node is pushed and poped out of the queue once and there will h NULL becuase there are h levels)
 * Auxillary space : O(width)/O(n) (width almost n/2)
