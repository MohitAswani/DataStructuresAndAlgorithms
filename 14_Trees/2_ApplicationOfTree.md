# Applications of tree :

* To represent hierarchical data :
    * Organization structure
    * Folder structure
    * XML/HTML content ( JSON objects )
    * In OOP (inheritance)

* Binary search trees

* Binary heap (used to represent priority queue which is extremely useful in many algorithms)

* B and B+ trees in DBMS (used for indexing)

* Spanning and shortest path trees in computer networks ( used in bridges and routers)

* Parse tree and expression tree in compiler ( used to parse the code ).

# Variations of trees used in practise :

* Trie (used to represent dictionaries , also support prefix search)

* Suffix tree (used to search for patterns in strings)

* Binary index tree (used for range query search / faster for limited set of operations)

* Segment tree (used for range query search / more powerful)
