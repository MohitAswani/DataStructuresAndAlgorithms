    * After the completion of the algo we get two partitions one having elements less than or equal to pivot and 
    other having elements greater or equal to pivot.
    * Time complexity :O(n)
    * Auxillary space :O(1)
    * In lomuto the pivot element was being placed in its correct position but in this that is not happening
    * This is the reason why we have different program of quick sort for these partitions.
    * But Hoare's partition does way less comparisions as compared to lomuto and works better.
    * Hoare's partition is not stable  and this can be seen when all the elements are same . Then only the swap will work in the while loop.
